CLEAN CASH KIT â€” QUICKSTART (5 steps)

1) Write your top 3 money wins for this month (e.g., 'Pay $200 extra to Card A').
2) Fill out Income and Fixed Bills in Budget.xlsx (tabs at the bottom).
3) Set weekly caps for Groceries, Dining, and Fun in the Variable tab.
4) List debts in smallest-to-largest order and direct any extra to the smallest balance (snowball).
5) Print the HabitTracker.pdf and check off one small daily action (e.g., 'No delivery', 'Move $10 to EF').

Tip: Update your budget once a week for 5 minutes. Lightweight beats perfect.
